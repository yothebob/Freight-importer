How to use Freight Importer: 

SETUP:

inside the freight_importer folder there will be a file called freight_importer with a floppy disk icon and the type will be 'application'. This is the EXE, right click it to create shortcut for your desktop.


DIRECTIONS:

1 - running the App will give you a terminal window and a small GUI with 2 buttons. be patient, some things may take a minute to load.

2 - press 'open file' to attach an excel estimate.

3 - once file is attached press 'Transfer Data'. This will transfer all the parts onto the freight excel sheet.

4 - It will print on the Terminal all the materials it grabbed from the estimate. After the list it will ask you what you want to name your freight quote. please type in the terminal after the '?', then press enter.

5 - Also give you a ROUGH estimation for pallets/ bundles(sapa size bundles). It should save your freight excel file in the 'freight_importer' folder. 

Please let me know if you have any problems and at what step it occurs.

Thanks!
